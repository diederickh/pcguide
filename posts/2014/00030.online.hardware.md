# Hardware

This chapter is a tough one, and mainly based on our own experiences
and from comment we got from users who emailed us. Getting the correct
hardware for you project is an important task. Do you want to use multiple
screens, do you need a lot of hardware, what cpu, etc. This chapter is 
divided into specific parts that we find are important to look at when 
buying a PC. 

## Mother Board

## Graphics Card

## Harddisk (SSD, HDD)

## Memory
