# Standards used in this guide

There are a couple of common words we will use to refer to aspects
which are important when creating the ultimate PC for your installation.
These are: 

 - `PC`: This is the computer we will create by following this guide. 
 - `Your Mac`:  When we refer to "Your Mac" we mean the computer you use 
    at the office, at home, etc.. this is your work computer.
 - `Client`: When we use the word client, we refer to the institution where
    your PC will be installed. This will probably be some remote location, 
    a museum, conference, etc...

When we describe that you need to edit some configuration file we use 
the following notations:

  - `+ SomeText`  When we use the + with some text it means that you need 
    to add some text to the file. Do not add the + sign and the space after it.
