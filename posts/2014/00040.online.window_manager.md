# Setting Up a Window Manager

A window manager controls the placement and appearance of windows 
using a windowing system in a graphical interface (wikipedia). Basically this
is what will give you windows. Think about things like Chrome, Opera, iTunes
which all run inside a Window. 

For our PC we will be using a very minimal window manager called [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/).
xmonad is a dynamically tiling X11 window manager that is written and configured 
in Haskell. In a normal WM, you spend half your time aligning and searching 
for windows. xmonad makes work easier, by automating this. (from their website).
We will also install [xmobar](http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/) which is a tiny text based application selector, similar
the Sportlight on Mac. 

To install xmonad and xmobar we need to install a couple of other packages 
as well.  Lets start with that now and later create a minimal configuration.

_Make sure your package list is up-to-date_
````sh
# pacman -Sy
````

_Install the packages we need for xmonad and xmobar_
````sh
# pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit xorg-server-utils
# pacman -S xorg-twm xorg-xclock xterm
# pacman -S haskell-haskeline
# pacman -S xmonad
# pacman -S xmonad-contrib
# pacman -S xmobar
# pacman -S rxvt-unicode
# pacman -S git
# pacman -S chromium # choose 1)ttf-bitstream-vera
# pacman -S freeglut
# pacman -S dmenu

Before we continue we assume that you have an nvidia card. We have tested the 
steps described in this guide using different PC setups which were all using
a nvidia GPU. So before continuing, install the nvidia drivers. Here we assume
you have a new nvidia card to. See the [nvidia](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA)
page on the Arch Linux wiki if you're not sure what kind of card you have. 

[@todo list tested cards] 

_Install the nvidia driver_
````sh
# pacman -S nvidia
````

After executing that command it may ask you to remove the currently installed 
nvidia drivers. If so, enter `y` to remove the currently installed ones and replace
them with the newer versions.  You'll see something like this:

````sh

We are going to use the `roxlu` account on the PC as the main user account. 
Therefore we will setup xmonad for this user. If you want to setup xmonad for 
another user just follow these instructions. 

## Setup the Window Manager

Login as the user that will be the default user for the PC. I'm using the `roxlu` 
user account for this. After logging in we will first setup xmonad.

_Create the directory for the configuration of xmonad_
````sh
$ cd ~
$ mkdir .xmonad
````

_Create the ~/.xmonad/.xmonad.hs configuration file_
````sh
cd ~/.xmonad
emacs -nw xmonad.hs
````

_Paste this into your ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs file_
````sh
import XMonad
main = do
     xmonad $ defaultConfig {
        terminal    = "urxvt",
        borderWidth = 3
    }
````

Note: when you can't launch dmenu (see below), you might need to add 
`modMask` to the xmonad.hs file. To do so add the following line after
`borderWidth=3`. Also add a comma after `borderWidth = 3`.

_Fix modifier key in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs_
````sh
modMask = mod4Mask
````

Next we create the configuration for xmobar. This configuration file does not do much
more then setting up a basic bar at the top of the screen which shows somw information.
This file is created in `~/.xmobarrc`

_Create the file ~/.xmobarrc with the following contents_
````sh
Config { font = "-misc-fixed-*-*-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
                , bgColor = "black"
                , fgColor = "grey"
                , border = BottomB
                , borderColor = "grey"
                , hideOnStart = False
                , persistent = True
                , position = Top
                , lowerOnStart = True
                , commands = [ Run Weather "EGPF" ["-t","<station>: <tempC>C","-L","18","-H","25","--normal","green","--high","red","--low","lightblue"] 36000
                             , Run Network "eth0" ["-L","0","-H","32","--normal","green","--high","red"] 10
                             , Run Network "eth1" ["-L","0","-H","32","--normal","green","--high","red"] 10
                             , Run Cpu ["-L","3","-H","50","--normal","green","--high","red"] 10
                             , Run Memory ["-t","Mem: <usedratio>%"] 10
                             , Run Swap [] 10
                             , Run Com "uname" ["-s","-r"] "" 36000
                             , Run Date "%a %b %_d %Y %H:%M:%S" "date" 10
                             ]
                , sepChar = "%"
                , alignSep = "}{"
                , template = "%cpu% | %memory% * %swap% | %eth0% - %eth1% }{ <fc=#ee9a00>%date%</fc>| %EGPF% | %uname%"
 }
````

Create the `~/.xinitrc` file which is read by `xinit` and by it's frond-end `startx`. 
It is mainly used to execute desktop environments, window managers and other programs when 
starting the X server.

_Create ~/.xinitrc_
````sh
$ emacs -nw ~/.initrc
````

_Paste this into (you can remove all other contents if you want to) ~/.xinitrc_
````sh
xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr
xmobar&
exec xmonad
````
