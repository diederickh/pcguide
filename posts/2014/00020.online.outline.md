# Outline

What will this guide cover? We surely are not trying to create a "how to use Linux"
guide, or to explain you how setup a mailing server, but  we will try to provide a
complete and clear description to make the best possible setup for running interactive
installations for museums, conferences, art shows, etc... We target mainly at people
who work with [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc), [Cinder](http://www.libcinder.org), 
[Polycode](http://www.polycode.org), or any other creative coding like framework. 

We will try to discuss as much as possible about getting a PC working for a 
interactive installations. This means we will talk about what parts to buy for 
your PC based on our experiences, what hardware to use in what situations, how to 
install a basic Arch Linux system, how to monitor your applications, startup & shutdown
scripts, remote management etc..
