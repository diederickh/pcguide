# About

The last couple of years I've been tinkering about finding the 
most optimal solution for a PC that we can use for the interactive 
installations we work on. I noticed I wasn't the only one. [James Acres](https://twitter.com/jimmyacres)
and [Hellicar & Lewis](https://twitter.com/HellicarLewis) have shown 
the same interest. In 2013 I started using [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) 
for development to see how well it would work for development, testing, etc.  

I've had some experience with Linux before and was aware that it is 
an open source project which is developed mostly by enthusiasts and that
companies often forget to also target Linux. Though the last years I think
this has changed a lot. I remember using Linux for the first time years 
ago and how mad I got because there just wasn't a decent way to create 
documents.  I think Linux has come a long way the last years and I think it's
time that we can start using it as a base for our interactive installations.

Although I'm a big fan of Mac OS X and a bit less Windows, I think Linux has
a couple of features which are very valuable for the installations we work on
Some of these are:

 - Has great support for remote access. 
 - It's minimal, it gives you just what you need.
 - Highly configurable.
 - Great for auto start / stop situations
 - OpenGL support is very good
 - It's a great platform for development 

This guide is meant to provide a complete working Arch Linux installation, 
with custom specifications and targetted on running full screen, kiosk like
OpenGL applications. It is the basis for the PCs we use in our projects.
